Discover cool new voices and reuse them. Performers, musicians, sound effects, two party dialog scenes. Save and share them. Every audio clip saves a speaker.npz file with the voice. To reuse a voice, move the generated speaker.npz file (named the same as the .wav file) to the "prompts" directory inside "bark" where all the other .npz files are.
